This is my portfolio website repository were I describe myself, show my projects and talk about my work. It is available in both portuguese and english, translated with the i18next standards.

I have also integrated my blog into this project in the version 4.0.0, so it can be much comfortable for me to keep everything up to date, you can check it [here](https://codenut-dev.vercel.app/blog).
