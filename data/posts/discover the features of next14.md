While many of us are still in the process of exploring the now old Next.js 13 and now Vercel stroked again with the new version of its beloved React.js framework. The new Next.js 14 brings some game-changing features, whether you’re already a Next.js enthusiast or just getting started.

Additionally, be aware of some breaking changes, including the minimum Node.js version being raised to 18.17 and a few API modifications, so is good to stay up-to-date with the latest changes to get the most of Next.js.

## The Highlights

Now, you can expect a 53% faster on local server startup, remarkable 94% faster code update with Fast Refresh and Turbopack is expected to move to “stable” in an upcoming minor release. Additionally, you don’t have to change a single line of code in your existing Next.js project to reap these new performance benefits.

It’s the kind of upgrade that we all were wondering for.

### Server Actions: Simplify Data Mutations

The need to create a dedicated API routes for server-side code is changing with Next.js 14. he introduction of Server Actions into stable release status is a big upgrade.

You can now write server-side code securely with a function defined inside your React component. It simplifies your code and provides better user experience by reducing the number of network roundtrip needed for data mutations and page re-rendering.

Take this demo example:

```tsx
export default function Page() {
  async function create(formData: FormData) {
    'use server';
    const fooId = await createFoo(formData);
  }

  return (
    <form action={create}>
      <input type='text' name='name' />
      <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### The new `Metadata` object

Metadata options for meta tags have been enhanced to improve the initial rendering performance and reduce layout shift.

### Partial Pre-rendering

Next.js 14 brings you the best of both sides of SSR and SSG with the new Partial Pre-rendering lineup.

It provides a fast initial static response while streaming dynamic content based on your React Suspense boundaries so you get the performance of static sites and the dynamism of server-rendered applications.

There are no new APIs to learn. It’s a smart move that simplifies your development experience.

## Summary

- Turbopack improved local development performance: 53% faster local server startup, and 94% faster code updates with Fast Refresh;

- Metadata improvements ensure that important metadata are sent with initial page content, preventing page undesired layout shift;

- Server Actions allow execution of server-side code without the need for a dedicated API route;

- Partial Pre-rendering provides a fast initial static response while streaming dynamic content based on React Suspense boundaries.
