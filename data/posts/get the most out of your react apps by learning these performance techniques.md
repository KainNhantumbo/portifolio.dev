In this article, I’ll share with you some performance tips that will supercharge your React development. Now get ready to optimize and make your apps blazing-fast. Okay, let’s dive in!

**1. Use Functional Components and React Hooks.**\
We all know functional components with React Hooks offer better performance compared to the old class components.

They are lighter and don’t carry the overhead of managing instance properties, avoiding unnecessary re-renders and boost your app’s performance.

**2. Use `useMemo` to Memoize Expensive Computations in your Components.**\
If you have expensive computations or complex data manipulation in your components, you can optimize them with the `useMemo` hook.

It memoizes the result of the computation, preventing unnecessary re-calculations.

With this hook, you ensure that the expensive computation is only performed when the dependencies change.

**3. Optimize your CSS and Layout Render Performance.**\
Consider using CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components or emotion that generate optimized CSS.

Minimize the use of inline styles and prefer external stylesheets for better caching and performance.

Also, be aware of any undesired re-renders caused by frequently changing styles.

**4. Use _Code Splitting_ and _Lazy Loading_.**\
Leverage code splitting and lazy loading to load only the necessary code when it’s needed, reducing the initial bundle size and improving loading speed.

`React` provides the `React.lazy` function for dynamically loading your components. In the end, your app loads faster, improving the overall performance.

**5. Optimize Re-rendering with `React.memo`.**\
Use `React.memo` to memoize functional components and prevent unnecessary re-renders. The component will only re-render if its props change, preventing unnecessary updates.

**6. Use Profile Tools and Analyze Performance.**\
Make a good use and take advantage by using performance profiling tools like **React DevTools Profiler** or **Chrome DevTools** Performance tab to identify performance bottlenecks.

Analyze render times, component lifecycles and expensive operations to optimize your application performance.

> That's it for now, I hope you use these performance tips to level up your next React projects and help you build high-performing, responsive, lightning-fast and user-friendly applications.

Thanks for reading and... Happy coding!
